# Voice Based Chatbots
OpenCog is an open-source software framework for artificial general intelligence (AGI) research and development. OpenCog focuses on creating intelligent software agents that can exhibit advanced cognitive abilities, including learning, reasoning, and decision-making. It incorporates a variety of AI techniques, such as probabilistic reasoning, evolutionary learning, and natural language processing, to develop an AGI system
